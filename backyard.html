          <h3><span class='anchor' id='story'></span>Overview</h3>
          <p>I worked with Backyard Media Company, an early stage startup, to build a new web-based product connecting local communities. The founders had identified that many of their neighbors lacked a sense of belonging to the city, despite loving their environment.</p>
          <p>Backyard Media sought to bridge the gap between self and community, better informing and involving their neighborhoods and cities.</p>
          <p>I spent several weeks exploring the user research they had already completed (interview notes), redefining their information architecture, and building wireframes for the online community prototype.</p>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='objective'></span>Objective:</h3>
          <blockquote>Work with founder to understand user needs, build out a functional information architecture for the prototype, and create wireframes to hand off to developers.</blockquote>

          <h3><span class='anchor' id='research'></span>Research</h3>
          <p>I was lucky enough to join at a point when the Backyard Media team had already conducted a significant amount of user research, including user feedback and interviews, behavioral observation, and network mapping. With this understanding, I was able to </p>
          <b>Patterns that had emerged:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>People loved their community, but few felt like they "belonged"</li>
            <li>Local news was available but siloed</li>
            <li>Local news was hard to track and understand</li>
            <li>Community news lived in email lists, Facebook groups, and Nextdoor</li>
            <li>Most people heard about community groups through word of mouth</li>
            <li>The most close-knit groups often had the highest standards for new members, so the ability to police membership was important for maintaining group trust</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Survey results</h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>Tentative "how might we" statements guided our design:
            <ul>
              <li>How might we encourage community members to invest time and energy into being informed?</li>
              <li>How might we lower the barrier to entry to get community members engaged with their neighborhoods?</li>
              <li>How might we make it easier for community members to become better informed and involved with local politics?</li>
              <li>How might we support people to discover community groups?</li>
              <li>How might we provide tools for community groups to self-moderate and reduce dramatic and polarized behaviors from their members?</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>Ideation</h4>
          <p>Early on, our lead stakeholder asked us to explore ways to interest users in participating in the online community daily. I proposed that we incentivize consistent participation by looking into gamification - establishing a point system where users gain points when they read articles or add comments, and when they help explain articles or rewrite them for the younger crowd. I only had fleeting ideas for what the points could be used towards (glamming avatars? special badges?), but felt it was important to keep pushing forward through the process and jotting ideas down throughout.</p>

          <p>Since the team had completed their user research, it allowed me to concentrate on "how" to approach the solution instead of "what" the problem was. I was very excited while developing the sitemap, as the team had presented so many great ideas for product features. As I presented my ideas to the founder each week, I learned more about the community needs and continued to refine my work to better support those needs.</p>
          <p>I handed the project off after building the wireframes, since I had just accepted a full-time role with another company. I hope they will find my sitemap and wireframes useful in developing the final product. I'm excited to stay in touch with the Backyard Media team to see how they continue to develop and expand the community prototype.</p>

How did the problem change as you learned more? How did you adapt (iterate, refine, pivot) the solution as you learned? Which of your most precious ideas did you kill off in the process?

How did you feel at different parts of the project? When were you most excited? When were you most frustrated?
Lastly (and one of the most important)â€¦ what did you learn throughout the process?
