          <h3><span class='anchor' id='story'></span>Overview</h3>
          <p>I was the sole UX designer for Restaurant365's custom operations forecast tools.</p>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='objective'></span>Objective:</h3>
          <blockquote>The ultimate goal for our web scheduling application was a smart scheduling system - a powerful predictive tool to identify labor costs.</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>While a forecast based on historical data won't provide perfectly accurate results, it would give managers valuable insights and help them make essential decisions about how to allocate their resources. After we finished work on the web scheduling application, I moved onto ideating and sketching for this smart scheduling system.
          <p>The smart scheduling system would generate predictions based on past sales and anticipated events. Enable upper-level management to create forecasts of their store's sales based on past sales data, considering coupons, weather, and upcoming events; leverage projected sales data to forecast their labor needs on a weekly basis; and allow store managers to use their expertise to staff their store.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='sales'></span>Sales Forecasting</h3>
          <p>As an accounting/operations software, R365 integrated with customers' point of sales system. The information pulled from the POS would be a valuable point of reference for forecasts, so that managers could identify shifts in sales amounts as they occurred throughout the day.</p>
          <p>I included the following features in my designs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A way for managers to add context to sales. Each day might have a coupon, special promotion, and/or an event - which in turn would impact sales. <a href="./img/r365/clf-wf1.png"/>Early wireframes</a> allowed managers to 'flag' certain weeks, but testing revealed that this was insufficient without descriptor text explaining why a week was flagged. I ended up incorporating <b>tags</b>.</li>
            <li>Weather information, which was important for restaurant locations dealing with snow or other extreme conditions.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='labor'></span>Labor Forecasting</h3>
          <p>We enabled store and district managers to pull from their forecasted sales to create labor projections for future weeks. Labor calculations are not always linear, so this required a three-pronged approach:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A matrix for admins/managers to designate how much staff their location required, based on sales data</li>
            <li>A weekly breakdown of labor forecast, with projections from our custom sales forecast tool</li>
            <li>Updating the Scheduling web app to include each week's projected labor hours</li>
          </ul>
            <h4>Building the Matrix</h4>
            <p>We heard from customers of their need to consider different types of labor hours:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Variable Labor: Servers, hosts, or cooks; hours depended on estimated sales.</li>
              <li>Fixed Labor: Managerial staff or maintenance. Managers knew exactly how many hours were needed and on what days of the week.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>WHAT IS THE MATRIX lalala. Users would ideally only need to build the matrix once, and add to it when creating new job codes.</p>

            <img src="./img/r365/clf-pr2.png"/> <img src="./img/r365/clf-pr3.png"/>
            <h4>Updating the Forecast</h4>
            <p>My designs had the following focal points:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>System-generated information visible but in the background. We wanted users to understand that they could rely on the system's default forecast, but we would always defer to their knowledge.</li>
              <li>Ability to edit forecast. Those with the right security clearance could edit the forecast, but a higher-up would need to approve it. I <a href="./img/r365/clf-wf2.jpg"/>ideated</a> with the product owner on ways to visualize changes made by the user. We ended up using <a href="./img/r365/clf-pr1.png"/>slight changes in typography</a> to represent changes.</li>
              <li>Ability to reset the forecast to the R365 default.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="./img/r365/clf-pr1.png"/>
            <h4>Visibility on Web Scheduler</h4>
            <p>The addition of Custom Labor Forecast meant we needed to make some tweaks to our Scheduling web application. Variable Labor hours would need to be indicated on the schedule, so that scheduling managers  would know if they'd scheduled the appropriate number of hours for each job. I explored different ways to flag these time intervals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Time intervals needing attention listed the labor hour variance in red.</li>
              <li>Correctly scheduled time intervals were marked with a green checkmark.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="./img/r365/clf-pr4.jpg" />
            <img src="./img/r365/clf-pr5.jpg" />
            <p>Managers would still need to review their work and determine how much labor they truly needed throughout the day. Since actual sales won't necessarily line up with each day's sales forecast, it naturally follows that projected labor generated by the labor matrix won't be exact. Managers instead will need to adjust to optimize their labor throughout the day.

        <h3><span class='anchor' id='validation'></span>Validation</h3>
        <p>We received positive feedback when demoing the forecasting prototypes with users. Labor Forecasting in particular landed well with them. Once it was ready for rollout to our customers, we witnessed an adoption rate of 200 accounts, with at least 5 customers publishing a week's worth of forecasting data to multiple locations at a time.</p>
        <h4>Reflection and next steps</h4>
        <p>Working on operations forecasting was an interesting look at a manager's processes. I enjoyed the idea of helping restaurant managers get the most out of the data available to them. While it is a helpful tool for managers, it should still be where only a percentage of their time is spent. Projections can help, but the important thing is for them to use the tool quickly and return to their other duties.</p>
