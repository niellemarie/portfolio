          <h3><span class='anchor' id='story'></span>Overview</h3>
          <p>My product manager asked me to design a custom financial report builder. Here's what happened.</p>
          <p>I love challenges - being able to wrap my mind around an issue, try out new ideas, and learn and grow through trial and error. Restaurant365 plays a key role in bridging the gap between the mastermind builders of financial reports (accounting managers) and those who aren't as familiar with financial reporting but need to extract the key data for a restaurant or two (restaurant managers)</p>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='objective'></span>Objective:</h3>
          <blockquote>Design a modern custom financial report builder that can handle power users' needs while modernizing traditional accounting software.</blockquote>

          <h3><span class='anchor' id='discovery'></span>Discovery</h3>
          <p>It was a challenge trying to structure and present complex financial data in a minimalistic, approachable way, while providing power users the freedom to do whatever they needed to. While there were existing financial reporting software out there, many looked like they were out of the 90s or looked like Microsoft Excel.</p>
          <p>I spent hours chasing down software and applications that functioned similarly - mainly website builders, a</p>
          <p>I had to keep it consistent with the rest of the R365 platform, so I tried to retain elements and use design patterns that existing users were already familiar with.</p>
          <b>Considerations:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>What needs to be visible</li>
            <li>The thought process of accountants</li>
            <li>What they are used to seeing</li>
            <li>Ways that we can streamline their experience (inserting default dates for the most frequently selected ones, selecting favorite reports, the ability to find a report based on the template it was created from)</li>
          </ul><br>
          <b>The challenge:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>modernizing without "dumbing it down"</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Personas</h4>
          <p>Personas
  - IT Manager: Familiar with software, comfortable switching around, not resistant to change. Finds it easy to locate answers he needs. Motivated, always learning, looks for options.
  - Accounting Manager: Picks up software easily, but high resistance to change. Develops routines quickly and likes to stick to them. Comfortable with Excel and other complex software. Does not actively look for alternatives. Power user, complete with shortcuts. Prefers using keyboard and not using mouse at all.
  - Restaurant Manager: Low level of tech-savviness. Mild resistance to change but doesn't use the software often enough that they recognize what changes. Every login feels new, since they often have to relearn it anyway. Easily overwhelmed by lots of data. Often thinking about other things and gets lost in thought. Need to make it as simple as possible for them since they don't need to spend too much time in the system.
    - Want to run and view reports
    - Want to schedule shifts
    - Want to approve/deny shift requests/requests for time off</p>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='design'></span>Design</h3>
          <p>Challenges included scope. With so many feature ideas, it was a little overwhelming trying to grasp the sheer scope of the project. I spent a lot of time working with the product owner and developers to explore possibilities for the solution and implementation.</p>
