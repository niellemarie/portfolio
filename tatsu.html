          <h3><span class='anchor' id='overview'></span>Overview</h3>
          <p>A while ago, I had the opportunity to try out a restaurant called Tatsu Ramen. Their order process is slightly different from typical restaurants. At Tatsu, you enter your order and pay on an iPad before entering the restaurant.</p>
          <p>The process immediately reminded me of ramen restaurants in Japan. There, you select your ramen bowl on a vending machine, insert your cash payment, and receive a ticket printout. You then queue for a seat at the bar. Once you're seated, you hand the chef your ticket printout, receive your order, eat, and leave.</p>
          <p>While I thought Tatsu's iPad order experience itself was quite efficient, the rest of the customer experience left much to be desired. I wasn't permitted to sit at one of the 4 open tables at my leisure, instead being told that I'd receive a text when a table was ready. I (along with half a dozen other people who ordered shortly after me) milled around aimlessly outside the restaurant for a few minutes before I received a text message and the hostess ushered me to a seat at the bar.</p>
          <p>Unimpressed, I set forth to find ways to make the experience at Tatsu more satisfying.</p>

          <h4>Objective:</h4>
              <blockquote>Examine Tatsu Ramen's order process and design an alternative experience that will provide customers with greater satisfaction.</blockquote>

          <h3><span class='anchor' id='research'></span>Research</h3>
          <p>I wanted to make sure I wasn't just designing for myself, so I took input from others who had dined at Tatsu Ramen. I paid special attention to mentions of the iPad, since it was a key part of the unique experience Tatsu offered.</p>
          <h4>User insights</h4>
          <b>Pros:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Under ideal conditions, ordering through the iPad allowed customers a seamless dining experience.</li>
            <li>The iPad made it easy for customers to add modifications.</li>
            <li>Since the iPad automatically calculated order totals as customers added items, it offered greater price transparency.</li>
            <li>iPad made it easier for groups to pay - instead of having to make a special request to split their bill, they could order separately.</li>
            <li>iPad gave customers more control over their order and ensured that there were no miscommunications with the order process.</li>
          </ul><br />
          <b>Cons:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>It was more difficult for customers to add items or order anything additional after initially ordering, since they would have to go back to the iPad.</li>
            <li>The iPad prompted customers to tip before experiencing the service, which some were uncomfortable with.</li>
            <li>Their order/seating process caused congestion at the restaurant entrance.</li>
            <li>An inattentive server may still deliver the wrong order.</li>
            <li>There was a drop-off in happiness as customers had to wait for their table after ordering. Some felt as if they were being held hostage until their food was ready, since they had already paid.</li>
            <li>Customers were unable to select where they sat (table vs bar seating) via the iPad.</li>
            <li>There were no menus out on display, so indecisive people caused crowding at the iPads. Under a traditional order flow, servers would be able to leave the table to give customers more time and come back later to take their order.</li>
            <li>There was not a sitting/waiting area outside for customers who had already placed their orders but hadn't been seated at a table.</li>
            <li>The order won't get sent to the kitchen until you're seated, so you still have to wait for your food.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><span class='anchor' id='problem'></span>Problem Statement</h3> 
          <p>Kelly wants to dine solo at Tatsu Ramen on a Wednesday afternoon, when there typically isn't a big crowd. She has to wait a while for a table despite seeing many open seats in the restaurant. When she is finally seated at the bar, the server mistakenly delivers her ramen bowl to someone else at the bar. Kelly is unhappy with her experience because she feels like her time is not valued.</p>

          <blockquote>I gave myself 10 minutes to sketch out possible ways to improve the overall Tatsu experience. I tried to develop at least one solution for each problem I encountered in the user research phase.</blockquote><br />
