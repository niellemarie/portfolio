          <h3><span class='anchor' id='story'></span>Overview</h3>
          <p>I was the sole UX designer for Restaurant365's shift scheduling web app. R365 wanted to update the look & feel of its existing scheduling software, give it more robust features, and bring it up to speed with more modern tools.</p>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='objective'></span>Objective:</h3>
          <blockquote>Identify needs of restaurant managers in scheduling their employees, build scheduling system to meet those needs, and validate system functionality with managers of various restaurant sizes.</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>I worked closely with the product owner and engineering team, from grooming user stories to prototyping and testing the usability of new features. We started out by conducting interviews with current clients to understand their restaurants' needs. From there, we identified the pain points our users were facing when using the existing scheduler.</p>
          <p>We began ideating and sketching for a smart scheduling system, where managers could forecast hourly labor needs based on past sales and anticipated events.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='research'></span>Design</h3>
          <p>Discovery had already been completed by the time I was assigned to this project. The product owner brought me up to speed on what had already been learned from customers, so we could get straight to the ideation process.</p>
          <b>What we wanted to explore:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Potential users' current participation in online communities</li>
            <li>The methods they used to learn more about their fields/industries of interest</li>
            <li>Experiences with mentorship and collaborative learning</li>
            <li>Resources used during career searching, and opportunities for new resources</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>User survey</h4>
          <p>Since our potential user base included females of all ages, wording the survey appropriately for each target group was challenging. Our screener questions directed each set of participants to a different section: younger students, older students, and professionals.</p>
          <p>We brainstormed distribution channels for the survey. In addition to past B-STEM program participants, we considered existing online community groups (Slack, Discord, Facebook), offline community groups (local Girl Scouts troops), and word of mouth (accessing our family/friends's networks).</p>
          <p>We received 145 results from the survey, a great starting point for collecting information. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qygZA7DfQRnX-m4wWYZR-5DHyG8a6WDH-j7ZUPdGDm0/edit?usp=sharing">survey analysis</a> helped us understand our target audience. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFIalLLc5Y37UC3O8lISwJ9tg4WzL6TIsjuocWr-AcA/edit?usp=sharing">responses received</a> from our survey enabled us to fine-tune our user interview questions and ask more substantial, hard-hitting questions. We asked more specific questions to those who were willing to offer more insight by participating in user interviews.</p>
          <blockquote>When it comes to business opportunities and STEM education, what are the barriers and frustrations experienced by female students and professionals?</blockquote>
          <h4>User interview insights</h4>
          <p>
          <b>Pain points:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Inability to quickly adjust shift times and respond to changes in their organization like staff turnover</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
          </ul><br />
          <b>Common behaviors:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Resilience in the face of male-dominated fields</li>
            <li>Seeking out support from female-focused professional organizations</li>
            <li>Looking for validation/feedback from other women professionals to gain insights</li>
          </ul><br />
          <b>Common goals:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Encouraging girls to pursue STEM roles, starting in school and continuing throughout their proessional career</li>
            <li>Providing young women confidence and skills at a young age</li>
            <li>Removing "imposter syndrome" that many women develop during their career</li>
            <li>More inclusive environments to encourage women to participate</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='solution'></span>Solution</h3>
          <blockquote</blockquote>
          <p>Tentative "how might we" statements guided our design:
            <ul>
              <li>How might we bring together girls of different demographics to comfortably collaborate?</li>
              <li>How might we attract females to start using the community?</li>
              <li>How might we encourage girls to participate in the community and share their findings?</li>
            </ul></p>
          <h4>Information architecture</h4>
          <p>We developed and ran <b>open cardsorts</b> with previous survey participants to identify the most effective sitemap for the site. In analyzing the results of our cardsorts, we arrived at the following conclusions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>53% of participants paired "mentoring" and "networking" activities together. 33% classified "networking" under Community or related sections, while the remaining 14% admitted they didn't know what networking meant.</li>
            <li>40% categorized "projects" and "opportunities" together.</li>
            <li>46% wanted recent information presented together as a continuous feed, rather than having it separated out across multiple categories.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>User stories</h4>
          <p>We wrote <b>user stories</b> to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5G7nH6NQueMZkvH5qwOxIIlMRmTPC2frrD9aG6PWK4/edit#gid=0">detail the community's functionality</a>. Our developer found it very helpful to have these high-level requirements written out.</p>
          <p>Mapping out these user stories into their various <b>epics</b> helped us get a better idea of the scope of our project. Our team discussed how valuable each piece played in the overall B-STEM community experience, ultimately helping to assemble the MVP.</p>
          <h4>User scenarios</h4>
          <p>We illustrated how our various personas might use the community. Writing these <b>user scenarios</b> was an exercise in empathy, testing how well we understood how users would interact with the B-STEM community throughout their daily lives.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='design'></span>Design</h3>
          <h4>Sketching process</h4>
          <p>While my teammates worked on wireframing the profiles and registration process, I did some whiteboarding to visualize two of our main features: Projects and Opportunities. The user stories were the foundation for my sketches. My main challenge was condensing the information-dense sections and making them bite-sized for younger audiences.</p>
          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <p>I created wireframes using Sketch. "Opportunities" and "Projects" pages alike needed to be easy to skim but quick to filter, so that users could mindlessly browse if they were very open to ideas or drill down on the exact set of opportunities that fit what they were searching for.</p>
          <p>We were asked to focus primarily on building out content requirements during this stage, which I hadn't anticipated. It turned out to be an interesting exercise in product ownership - having to anticipate the exact fields a user would expect to see on a typical "post project" screen.</p>
          <h4>Feedback</h4>
          <p>During feedback, the lead stakeholder brought up the following points about the Project Posting wireframes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Members would want to see statistics for projects/opportunities, such as views/likes</li>
              <li>Project owners would want the option to disable comments</li>
              <li>Project owners and the community would want to flag comments</li>
              <li>Members would want to forward projects that caught their eye to other members or friends not part of the community, and be able to have a collection of these liked projects</li>
              <li>Members would want an easy way to access projects that they had favorited</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Ultimately, it was decided that these features were "nice to haves" and would not be included in the MVP.</p>
          <h4><span class='anchor' id='prototype'></span>Developing the prototype</h4>

          <h3><span class='anchor' id='validation'></span>Validation</h3>
          <h4>Reflection and next steps</h4>
          <p>I really enjoyed working with a team of designers, from the research phase to iterating on wireframes. Having multiple sets of eyes on my designs was very helpful to the process.</p>
          <p>I was most excited when writing the user stories for the Projects and Opportunities features. Being present during that crucial moment of shaping the product was a real treat.</p>
          <p>Plenty of feature ideas came up after we wrote those first user stories, so we had to make some tough calls to distinguish between "must haves" and "nice to haves". It was challenging when the team wasn't 100% in alignment on these. We had to be firm on the product's identity and the audience we were building the community for.</p>
          <p>Overall, I loved being able to contribute to a product that felt so engaging, and hope to find more opportunities where I can do the same!</p>
