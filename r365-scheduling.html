          <h3><span class='anchor' id='story'></span>Overview</h3>
          <p>I was the sole UX designer for Restaurant365's shift scheduling web app. R365 wanted to update the look & feel of its existing scheduling software, give it more robust features, and bring it up to speed with more modern tools.</p>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='objective'></span>Objective:</h3>
          <blockquote>Enable restaurant managers to schedule the right amount of hours, at the appropriate times, adjust quickly when necessary, and easily identify gaps in their scheduling. Identify needs of restaurant managers in scheduling their employees, build scheduling system to meet those needs, and validate system functionality with managers of various restaurant sizes.</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>I worked closely with the product owner and engineering team, from grooming user stories to prototyping and testing the usability of new features. Most of the discovery had already been completed by the time I was assigned to this project, but I was able to participate in a few client interviews to understand restaurants' needs. The product owner brought me up to speed on what had already been learned from customers, so we could get straight to the ideation process. From there, we identified the pain points our users were facing when using the existing scheduler.</p>
          <p>We began ideating and sketching for a smart scheduling system, where managers could forecast hourly labor needs based on past sales and anticipated events. </p>

          <h3><span class='anchor' id='research'></span>Design</h3>
          <p></p>
          <b>What we wanted to explore:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Current users' understanding and usage of the existing scheduling application</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Original R365 scheduling experience</h4>
          <p>The existing scheduling app only showed a weekly schedule. Users found it difficult to quickly make or create shifts, since selecting a particular shift took you to a different page. Doing so would mean you lose the context of other shifts and what’s already created. It was impossible to quickly identify overtime hours. There was a lot of information given upfront but everything was given equal weight, which made it harder to understand. One of the most painful sounding pieces of feedback we received:</p>
          <blockquote>Some managers chose to use an Excel sheet rather than create their schedules in the R365 system.</blockquote>
          <h4>User interview insights</h4>
          <p>
          <b>Pain points:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Inability to quickly adjust shift times and respond to changes in their organization like staff turnover</li>
            <li>Too many job codes leading to mistakenly removing irrelevant shifts</li>
            <li></li>
          </ul><br />
          <b>Common behaviors:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Resilience in the face of male-dominated fields</li>
            <li>Seeking out support from female-focused professional organizations</li>
            <li>Looking for validation/feedback from other women professionals to gain insights</li>
          </ul><br />
          <b>Common goals:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Encouraging girls to pursue STEM roles, starting in school and continuing throughout their proessional career</li>
            <li>Providing young women confidence and skills at a young age</li>
            <li>Removing "imposter syndrome" that many women develop during their career</li>
            <li>More inclusive environments to encourage women to participate</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='solution'></span>Solution</h3>
          <p>Wireframing</p>
          <img src="./img/r365/sch-wf1.png"/>
          <P>NEED TO UPDATE ACROBAT SO I CAN PULL OUT THE PDF</P>
          <p>Early version of the scheduler attempted to solve some of these issues, but still struggled with hierarchy and information density.</p>
          <p>I concentrated on providing a legible, easy-to-parse schedule that users would be able to quickly scan to find the information they wanted:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each employee’s job</li>
            <li>The number of hours they worked</li>
            <li>The number of shifts they were scheduled for that week.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I layered in important information so that someone can find it intuitively even if it is not immediately obvious on the page.</p>
          <p>First on our list for the new scheduling experience was a daily view so that managers could visualize their day hour-by-hour. We also implemented drag-and-drop functionality to update shift times or quickly assign a shift to an available employee. (NEED TO CREATE A SCREENGRAB) I also advocated for a quick filter view, so managers could quickly find employees with a given job code and their current schedules.</p>
          <p>My <a href="./img/r365/sch-wf2.jpg">early iterations</a> followed Material Design more closely and displayed shadows under each of the shifts. However, testing with real scheduling data revealed that managers often created many shifts to ensure sufficient coverage, which these early versions were not displaying properly. I decided to give overlapping shifts their own lines upon clicking on the “Multiple Shifts” line, using a carat as an affordance.</p>
          <p> In addition, we received feedback that it was important to see responsibilities associated with jobs at a glance, so I ended up including that on each shift card. Information like an employee’s star rating or the catering site that they might be assigned to for that shift were visible only when clicking on a specific shift.</p>
          <p>We introduced Departments, an attribute of Job Codes, so that administrators could organize their jobs by department. Each department could have its own daily Labor % and Sales per Labor Hour goals. This would enable managers in charge of a specific department (back of house or front of house, bar manager) to view and publish the shift for their department without worrying about potentially destructive actions like accidentally updating another department’s. Also restricts the view so you’re not looking at employees with job codes that have nothing to do with your department.</p>
          <h4>Final</h4>
          <img src="./img/r365/sch-pr1.jpg"/>
          <p>We developed and ran <b>open cardsorts</b> with previous survey participants to identify the most effective sitemap for the site. In analyzing the results of our cardsorts, we arrived at the following conclusions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>53% of participants paired "mentoring" and "networking" activities together. 33% classified "networking" under Community or related sections, while the remaining 14% admitted they didn't know what networking meant.</li>
            <li>40% categorized "projects" and "opportunities" together.</li>
            <li>46% wanted recent information presented together as a continuous feed, rather than having it separated out across multiple categories.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>User stories</h4>
          <p>We wrote <b>user stories</b> to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5G7nH6NQueMZkvH5qwOxIIlMRmTPC2frrD9aG6PWK4/edit#gid=0">detail the community's functionality</a>. Our developer found it very helpful to have these high-level requirements written out.</p>
          <p>Mapping out these user stories into their various <b>epics</b> helped us get a better idea of the scope of our project. Our team discussed how valuable each piece played in the overall B-STEM community experience, ultimately helping to assemble the MVP.</p>
          <h4>User scenarios</h4>
          <p>We illustrated how our various personas might use the community. Writing these <b>user scenarios</b> was an exercise in empathy, testing how well we understood how users would interact with the B-STEM community throughout their daily lives.</p>

          <h3><span class='anchor' id='design'></span>Design</h3>
          <h4>Sketching process</h4>
          <p>While my teammates worked on wireframing the profiles and registration process, I did some whiteboarding to visualize two of our main features: Projects and Opportunities. The user stories were the foundation for my sketches. My main challenge was condensing the information-dense sections and making them bite-sized for younger audiences.</p>
          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <p>I created wireframes using Sketch. "Opportunities" and "Projects" pages alike needed to be easy to skim but quick to filter, so that users could mindlessly browse if they were very open to ideas or drill down on the exact set of opportunities that fit what they were searching for.</p>
          <p>We were asked to focus primarily on building out content requirements during this stage, which I hadn't anticipated. It turned out to be an interesting exercise in product ownership - having to anticipate the exact fields a user would expect to see on a typical "post project" screen.</p>
          <h4>Feedback</h4>
          <p>During feedback, the lead stakeholder brought up the following points about the Project Posting wireframes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Members would want to see statistics for projects/opportunities, such as views/likes</li>
              <li>Project owners would want the option to disable comments</li>
              <li>Project owners and the community would want to flag comments</li>
              <li>Members would want to forward projects that caught their eye to other members or friends not part of the community, and be able to have a collection of these liked projects</li>
              <li>Members would want an easy way to access projects that they had favorited</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Ultimately, it was decided that these features were "nice to haves" and would not be included in the MVP.</p>

          <h4>Reflection and next steps</h4>
          <p>It was extremely satisfying to see the dev team's ongoing process for Scheduling. It really came to life. Being able to click on and interact with the things I'd designed was incredibly fulfilling. The next stp will be seeing customers (especially for our larger groups) interact with it and understanding/implementing their feedback.</p>
