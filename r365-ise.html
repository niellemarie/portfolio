          <h3><span class='anchor' id='story'></span>Overview</h3>
          <p>We heard from customers that the accounting-focused UI of R365's web application was not working for the operations side. While accounting users were accessing the app through a desktop and were primarily concentrating on duties within the software, operations managers had different priorities. Operations users used R365 to support and supplement their daily tasks. They needed to access information quickly and see only highlights of their day.</p>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='objective'></span>Objective:</h3>
          <blockquote>Facilitate a design sprint to imagine a new experience for operations users, enabling them to access actionable information quickly.</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='sprint'></span>Design Sprint</h3>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>We ran a design sprint with one of our biggest customers to better understand what information would be most important for these day-to-day operators. The R365 Product team wanted to discover ways to make it easier for our operations users to access what they need to on our system, and how to customize that experience.</p>
          <h4>Step 1: Mapping</h4>
          <p>We spent some time conversing about a restaurant's operations, hearing from experts on the R365 team as well as our client's. The product owner facilitated this discussion, taking notes on the whiteboard to delineate the daily processes for a shift manager, district leader, and GM. The mapping session helped us understand the flow of a manager's daily activity. During this time, I wrote down relevant "How Might We" notes on post-its.</p>
          <img src="./img/r365/ise-map1.jpg" />
          As a team, we placed these HMW statements on the board. Once we'd defined key questions and our long-term goal, each participant used stickers to mark the "How Might We" questions most pressing to them. This narrowed down our focus for this sprint to the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How might we show users a step-by-step list of what to do?</li>
            <li>How might we show users what "done" looks like?</li>
            <li>How might we help managers get their tasks done quickly and easily as possible, without disrupting their normal workflow?</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Step 2: Sketching</h4>
          <p>We sourced a handful of applications to be used as Lightning Demos. All participants discussed key elements of each application and why they were relevant for an operations dashboard.</p>
          <figure><img src="./img/r365/ise-ld1.jpg" /><figcaption>Results of Lightning Demos</figcaption></figure>
          <p>Next, we had each participant sketch out their own detailed solutions. It was fascinating to see the variety of approaches.</p>
          <figure><img src="./img/r365/ise-sk1.jpg" /></figure>
          <figure><img src="./img/r365/ise-sk3.jpg" /></figure>
          <H4>Step 3: Decide</H4>
          <p>At this point, our team had a stack of solutions. We used the "Sticky Decision" method to identify the most considerate solutions and decide which sketches should be prototyped and tested. We then combined those sketches into a storyboard to plan out the prototype.</p>
          <figure><img src="./img/r365/ise-sb2.jpg"/><figcaption>Storyboard based on the most effective solution sketches</figcaption></figure>
          <h4>Step 4: Prototype</h4>
          <p>I spent about an hour using Sketch to <a href="./sprint.pdf">quickly prototype</a> the storyboarded sketches. I connected my Macbook Pro to the conference room's projector so that our team could view and comment on the prototype as it was taking shape.</p>
          <figure><img src="./img/r365/ise-fin.jpg"/><figcaption>High-level overview of operations dashboard prototype</figcaption></figure>
          <h4>Step 5: Test</h4>
          <p>The product owner showed our prototype to three R365 employees who worked closely with our operations customers in 3 separate, 1:1 interviews. We set up a separate room so that the video feed would be broadcast to the conference room we were using for our design sprint.</p>
          <p>The constructive criticism we received was in regards to accessibility - small text was hard on the eyes, which is suboptimal for restaurant managers who don't have a lot of time to focus on one screen. In addition, one person commented that the flags made them feel like they couldn't go back to previous screens.</p>
          <p>Most of the feedback we received was extremely positive:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strikethroughs made sense: "As a restaurant manager, it's great to see 'just do this' so I don't have to think."</li>
            <li>Straightforward and intuitive navigation: "I love that I don't need to spend a lot of time to find anything."</li>
            <li>"Super duper easy for someone who's never worked in the industry before"</li>
            <li>Critical tasks clearly marked: "Nice to view non-critical tasks."</li>
            <li>The "Nailed It!" page put a smile on their face, and they liked that managers are incentivized to wonder "How can I get ahead when I'm already at the computer"</li>
          </ul>
          
        </article>
        <h3><span class='anchor' id='validation'></span>Validation</h3>
        <p>The prototype was used as a starting point for our new UX designer, who would take up the In-Store Experience mantle and build on it.</p>
        <h4>Reflection and next steps</h4>
        <p>I dearly enjoyed facilitating and taking part in this design sprint, and I look forward to the next time I'm able to partake in one. Here are a few tips I have for anyone looking to run a design sprint of their own:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a clear agenda, so participants understand what is expected of them and what they should hope to accomplish during the sprint.</li>
          <li>Design sprints are a great method to get stakeholders involved in an interactive way. The time you spend ideating together will help take the product to the next level!</li>
          <li>Don’t be afraid to speak up and be the bad cop to <b>rein in meandering discussions</b>. Subject-matter experts can be very passionate about their material and introduce trains of thought that aren’t within scope. You're limited with time in a design sprint, so make every moment count!</li>
          <li>Prompt more passive participants to contribute!</li>
          <li>Seek to <b>understand why</b>. A participant may have a good idea of what they want to see, but that might not necessarily be the most elegant solution or one that solves the problem at hand. Keep probing for answers - they'll appreciate that you care, and it may lead you down routes none of you had previously considered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let me know if you’re thinking about running a design sprint - I’d be happy to answer any questions you have about the process!</p>
