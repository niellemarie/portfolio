        <p>Hi, I'm Danielle Dayto. I'm actively seeking employment opportunities as a UX Designer in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Southern California in May 2014 with a double major in Business Administration and Accounting. I spent three years at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where I worked with companies in banking, technology, and entertainment.</p>
        <p>As much as I enjoyed my time in accounting, I wanted my work to make a positive impact on my clients' core products/services. Articles about UX caught my eye, so I checked out a few classic UX books and went down the rabbit hole from there.</p>
        <p>The business case studies at USC pushed us to determine a company's optimal path to achieve their goals with their current resources and limitations. I see user-centered design to be the other side of that coin - where and how the business's goals intersect with their intended users', how data can provide a better understanding of the customer base and how they experience the product/service, and how to effectively synthesize user concerns with the future of design.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I read magical realism novels, try out new restaurants, host board game nights, watch competitive figure skating, and travel.</p>
        <p>If you're in the LA area, I'd love to hear from you. I am also open to hearing about your side projects!</p>
