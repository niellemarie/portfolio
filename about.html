        <h4>Hi, I'm Danielle Dayto.</h4>
        <p>I'm actively seeking employment opportunities as a UX Designer in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>I graduated from USC in 2014 with a double major in Business and Accounting. I spent three years at PwC, where I
          worked with companies in banking, technology, and entertainment. As much as I enjoyed my time in accounting, I
          wanted my work to make a positive impact on my clients' core products/services.</p>
        <p>Articles about UX caught my eye, so I checked out a few classic UX books. User-centered design particularly fascinated
          me: Where and how do an organization's goals intersect with their intended users'? How can data provide a better
          understanding of the customer base and how they experience the product/service? How can one effectively synthesize
          user concerns with the future of design?</p>
        <p>Since then, I've gone headfirst down the rabbit hole, taking on challenges like the
          <a href="https://www.springboard.com/workshops/ux-design">Springboard UX Design course</a> and seeking out industry mentors for guidance and a healthy dose of reality. I'm
          always on the lookout for new UX meetups and hackathon-type events around the Los Angeles area, and I recently
          volunteered with the
          <a href="http://www.servicedesignjam.org/">LA Service Design Jam</a> to drive innovative thinking towards collaborative action.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I read magical realism novels, try out new restaurants, host board game nights, watch competitive
          figure skating, and travel.</p>
        <p>If you're in the LA area, I'd love to hear from you. I'm resourceful, a quick learner, and eager for opportunities
          to grow. I do have availability for new projects, so please contact me if you have something in mind!</p>
