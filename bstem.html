          <h3><span class='anchor' id='story'></span>Overview</h3>
          <p>As I was growing up, I was fortunate to be surrounded by a supportive group of girl friends - my troopmates from a youth organization called Girl Scouts. The organization empowers girls to lead with integrity, compassion, and confidence in all that they do.</p>
          <p>When I received the opportunity to work with B~STEM Project, an organization that provides programming for girls interested in business and STEM-related fields, I jumped at the chance. Their mission reminded me of my time in Girl Scouts and how it had helped prepare me for my own career. I was overjoyed at the prospect of working with a group that could make a similar impact on other girls' lives.</p>
          <p>I was paired with two other UX designers to build the prototype for a vibrant, online community - a resource to empower B~STEM Project members worldwide to meet, form their own groups for the organization's hackathons, continue communication after local events, and learn from each other. We planned to present our prototype to sponsors and donors by the end of July.</p>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='objective'></span>Objective:</h3>
          <blockquote>Validate the need for an online community for girls interested in business/STEM fields to learn from and work with each other, create a prototype for usability testing, and present findings to B~STEM Project's Board of Directors.</blockquote>

          <h3><span class='anchor' id='process'></span>Process</h3>
          <p>We started by mapping out the UX process, what steps were needed to complete the project, and determining who would take ownership of each step. I used Microsoft Project to clearly define how long each task would take and who would take ownership.</p>
          <a href="./img/bstem/timeline-1.png"><img src="./img/bstem/timeline-1.png" alt="Project Timeline" /></a>
          <p>Our remote team primarily communicated through a work messaging application called Slack. We used one channel for general updates and used direct group messages and scheduled quick calls for more detailed changes/updates.</p>

          <h3><span class='anchor' id='research'></span>Research and planning</h3>
          <p>We set out to design a survey that would simultaneously screen potential interview participants and validate females' need for an online community. We wanted to discover how potential users already learned more about their chosen business/STEM fields, and how comfortable they would be in connecting with like-minded females over the Internet.</p>
          <b>What we wanted to explore:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Potential users' current participation in online communities</li>
            <li>The methods they used to learn more about their fields/industries of interest</li>
            <li>Experiences with mentorship and collaborative learning</li>
            <li>Resources used during career searching, and opportunities for new resources</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>User survey</h4>
          <p>Since our potential user base included females of all ages, wording the survey appropriately for each target group was challenging. Our screener questions (gender and age range) directed each set of participants to a different section: younger students, older students, and professionals.</p>
          <p>We brainstormed distribution channels for the survey. In addition to past B-STEM program participants, we considered existing online community groups (Slack, Discord, Facebook), offline community groups (local Girl Scouts troops), and word of mouth (accessing our family/friends's networks).</p>
          <p>We received 145 results from the survey, a great starting point for collecting information. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qygZA7DfQRnX-m4wWYZR-5DHyG8a6WDH-j7ZUPdGDm0/edit?usp=sharing">survey analysis</a> helped us understand our target audience. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFIalLLc5Y37UC3O8lISwJ9tg4WzL6TIsjuocWr-AcA/edit?usp=sharing">responses received</a> from our survey enabled us to fine-tune our user interview questions and ask more substantial, hard-hitting questions. We asked more specific questions to those who were willing to offer more insight by participating in user interviews.</p>
          <blockquote>When it comes to business opportunities and STEM education, what are the barriers and frustrations experienced by female students and professionals?</blockquote>
          <h4>User interview insights</h4>
          <p>
          <b>Common frustrations:</b>
          <ul>
          </ul><br />
          <b>Common behaviors:</b>
          <ul>
          </ul><br />
          <b>Common goals:</b>
          <ul>
          </ul>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='solution'></span>Solution</h3>
          <blockquote</blockquote>
          <h4>Ideation</h4>
          <p>Early on, our lead stakeholder asked us to explore ways to interest users in participating in the online community daily. I proposed that we incentivize consistent participation by looking into gamification - establishing a point system where users gain points when they read articles or add comments, and when they help explain articles or rewrite them for the younger crowd. I only had fleeting ideas for what the points could be used towards (glamming avatars? special badges?), but felt it was important to keep pushing forward through the process and jotting ideas down throughout.</p>
          <p>Tentative "how might we" statements guided our design:
            <ul>
              <li>How might we bring together girls of different demographics to comfortably collaborate?</li>
              <li>How might we attract females to start using the community?</li>
              <li>How might we encourage girls to participate in the community and share their findings?</li>
            </ul></p>

          
          
          <h4>Information architecture</h4>
          <p>We developed and ran <b>open cardsorts</b> with previous survey participants to identify the most effective sitemap for the site. In analyzing the results of our cardsorts, we arrived at the following conclusions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>53% of participants paired "mentoring" and "networking" activities together. 33% classified "networking" under Community or related sections, while the remaining 14% admitted they didn't know what networking meant.</li>
            <li>40% categorized "projects" and "opportunities" together.</li>
            <li>46% wanted recent information presented together as a continuous feed, rather than having it separated out across multiple categories.</li>
          </ul><br />

          <h4>User stories</h4>
          <p>We wrote <b>user stories</b> to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5G7nH6NQueMZkvH5qwOxIIlMRmTPC2frrD9aG6PWK4/edit#gid=0">detail the community's functionality</a>. Our developer found it very helpful to have these high-level requirements written out.</p>
          <p>Mapping out these user stories into their various <b>epics</b> helped us get a better idea of the scope of our project. Our team discussed how valuable each piece played in the overall B-STEM community experience, ultimately helping to assemble the MVP.</p>

          <h4>User scenarios</h4>
          <p>We illustrated how our various personas might use the community. Writing these <b>user scenarios</b> was an exercise in empathy, testing how well we understood how users would interact with the B-STEM community throughout their daily lives.</p>

          <h4>Sketching process</h4>
          <p>While my teammates worked on wireframing the profiles and registration process, I did some whiteboarding to visualize two of our main features: Projects and Opportunities. The user stories were the foundation for my sketches. My main challenge was condensing the information-dense sections and making them bite-sized for younger audiences.</p>
          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <p>I created wireframes using Sketch.

          <h4>Reflection and next steps</h4>
          <p>I really enjoyed working with a team of designers, from the research phase to iterating on wireframes. Having multiple sets of eyes on my designs was very helpful to the process.</p>
          <p>Writing the user stories was exciting to me. Being present during that crucial moment of shaping the product was a real treat.</p>
          <p>Plenty of feature ideas came up after we wrote those first user stories, so we had to make some tough calls to distinguish between "must haves" and "nice to haves". It was challenging when the team wasn't 100% in alignment on these. We had to be firm on the product's identity and the audience we were building the community for.</p>
          <p>Overall, I loved being able to contribute to a product that felt so engaging, and hope to find more opportunities where I can do the same!</p>
