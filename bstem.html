          <h3><span class='anchor' id='story'></span>Overview</h3>
          <p>As I was growing up, I was fortunate to be surrounded by a supportive group of girl friends - my troopmates from a youth organization called Girl Scouts. The organization empowers girls to lead with integrity, compassion, and confidence in all that they do.</p>
          <p>When I received the opportunity to work with B~STEM Project, an organization that provides programming for girls interested in business and STEM-related fields, I jumped at the chance. Their mission reminded me of my time in Girl Scouts and how it had helped prepare me for my own career. I was overjoyed at the prospect of working with a group that could make a similar impact on other girls' lives.</p>
          <p>I was paired with two other UX designers to build the prototype for a vibrant, online community - a resource to empower B~STEM Project members worldwide to meet, form their own groups for the organization's hackathons, continue communication after local events, and learn from each other. We planned to present our prototype to sponsors and donors by the end of July.</p>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='objective'></span>Objective:</h3>
          <blockquote>Validate the need for an online community for girls interested in business/STEM fields to learn from and work with each other, create a prototype for usability testing, and present findings to B~STEM Project's Board of Directors.</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='process'></span>Process</h3>
          <p>We started by mapping out the UX process, what steps were needed to complete the project, and determining who would take ownership of each step. I used Microsoft Project (a software I was already familiar with) to clearly define how long each task would take and who would participate.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='research'></span>Research and planning</h3>
          <p>We set out to design a survey that would simultaneously screen potential interview participants and validate females' need for an online community. It was important to gauge what methods potential users already used to learn more about or find news about their chosen business/STEM fields, and how comfortable they would be in connecting with like-minded females over the Internet.</p>
          <b>What we wanted to explore:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Potential users' current participation in any online communities</li>
            <li>What specific fields/industries potential users were interested in</li>
            <li>What methods they used to learn more about those fields/industries</li>
            <li>Collaborative learning (their interest in finding others who were interested in similar topics)</li>
            <li>Experiences with mentorship (how users got connected with mentors/mentees, what they enjoyed about their mentorship experience, and what was frustrating about their mentorship experience)</li>
            <li>Diversity in the userbase (occupation/industry, level of schooling completed, employment status)</li>
            <li>What resources they relied on during their career search, and if there were any other resources they would have appreciated</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>User survey</h4>
          <p>Since our potential user base was so broad (females of all ages and working professional males), wording the survey appropriately for each target group was challenging. We set up the survey so that screener questions (gender and age range) would direct each set of participants to a different section: younger students, older students, and professionals.</p>
          <p>We brainstormed distribution channels for the survey. In addition to past participants, we considered existing online community groups (Slack, Discord, Facebook), offline community groups (local Girl Scouts troops), and word of mouth (reaching out through family/friends in various age groups).
          <h4>Competitors</h4>
          <h4>Survey results</h4>
          <p></p>
          <p>This helped to form tentative "how might I" statements to guide my design thoughts:
            <ul>
              <li>How might I help bring people together when they aren't aware they have common interests to talk about?</li>
              <li>How might I demonstrate to someone that their trust is well-placed?</li>
              <li>How might I encourage one to display their authentic self to someone new?</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>User interview insights</h4>
          <b>Common frustrations:</b>
          <ul>
          </ul><br />
          <b>Common behaviors:</b>
          <ul>
          </ul><br />
          <b>Common goals:</b>
          <ul>
          </ul>
          <h3><span class='anchor' id='solution'></span>Solution</h3>
          <blockquote>With this in mind, I set out to design an app that would focus on users’ common interests but also shine a spotlight on the interests unique to each person, in hopes that it would inspire new interests and different routes of conversation.</blockquote>
          <h4>Ideation</h4>
          <p>Early on, our lead stakeholder expressed concerns that she wanted us to explore ways to interest users in participating in the online community every day. I proposed that we incentivize consistent participation by looking into gamification - establishing a point system where users gain points when they read articles or add comments, and when they help explain articles or rewrite them for the younger crowd. I only had fleeting ideas for what the points could be used towards (glamming avatars? special badges?), but felt it was important to keep pushing forward through the process and jotting ideas down throughout.</p>

          What did you learn from the tests? What surprised you about the results?
How did the problem change as you learned more? How did you adapt (iterate, refine, pivot) the solution as you learned? Which of your most precious ideas did you kill off in the process?
How did you decide you were finished? Was it a clear marker, or did you have to make a tough call?
What was the final result? How did it get made? How did you measure its efficacy? Did you measure success?
How did you feel at different parts of the project? When were you most excited? When were you most frustrated?
Lastly (and one of the most important)… what did you learn throughout the process?
